- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cm0r6aN. I'm a Principal Software Engineer with 20+ years of full stack development experience; primarily Microsoft-centric.  I'm an Entreprenuer at heart, 
  with a list of (what I believe to be) highly profitable ideas.

I've lead the design, development, and implementation of numerous Enterprise solutions in a variety of industries and technologies. Including, but not limited to:
 - Web
 - Desktop
 - Services (Windows, REST, OPEN API, GPRC, etc...)
 - Finance 
 - Biometrics
 - Digital Forensics
 - SQL, Oracle, MySQL, Cassandra, COSMOS
 
- 👀 I’m interested in creating Web3 Dapps and Tokens with real, lasting utility

- 🌱 I’m currently researching networks and platforms to develop on. My top picks so far are Cardano, COSMOS, Avalanche, and the XRPL

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a few Web3 projects based around the tokenization of digital and physical assets. I have writeups (not whitepapers but detailed enough)
      and some artwork.  I'd love to link up with 1 or more experienced developers, a great designer, marketing experts, etc.
